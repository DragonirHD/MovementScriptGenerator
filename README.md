# MovementScriptGenerator
A tool to simplify the creation of movement scripts for Beat Saber

This tool enables you to create camera moves for the [Camera2](https://github.com/kinsi55/CS_BeatSaber_Camera2) mod and chain them together.
This can be used to create interesting and complex shots for distinct maps (dance videos / lightshows / etc.) or simpler, repeating shots as general camera movement (streaming content) all on a single camera, without needing any editing afterwards.

Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/DragonirHD/MovementScriptGenerator/wiki) to find detailed explanations on how to use the tool.

Downloads to the mod can be found on the [releases](https://github.com/DragonirHD/MovementScriptGenerator/releases) tab. Make sure to download the newest version.

See the promotional video [here](https://youtu.be/YGpfWJvm4Hs) to find out what the tool is currently capable of.

## Coming Features
All of these features have no definitive release date and are currently only ideas for what might be made next.
- A new field where it will be possible to chain moves together and edit the chain afterwards. (This will simplify the process of creating movements for entire songs) IMPLEMENTED
- saving and loading of moves IMPLEMENTED
- New Move Element: J-Turn
- New Other Element: Randomize 
- dark mode

## Why?
I wanted to use movement scripts to enhance my own videos and add more dynamics to them.
After trying to create a circular motion by hand in a movement script file and noticing that around 360 points would have to be defined
I tried to do it programmatically to simplify the process.
This idea culminated into this tool.
